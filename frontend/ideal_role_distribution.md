## Analysis Notes

**Key Insights:**
1. Frontend Engineer should primarily appear for U (User-facing) personalities
2. Backend Engineer should primarily appear for S (Systems-facing) personalities
3. Full Stack Engineer should appear for balanced personalities (U/S with moderate traits)
4. Specialized roles (ML, Security, Design) should only appear when traits strongly align
5. DevOps/SRE should appear for S-O (Systems-Operational) personalities
6. Growth/A/B Testing should appear for logic-driven user-facing types
7. QA should appear for structured, logic-driven personalities

**Distribution Goals:**
- Each of 61 roles should appear in at least 1-2 personality types' top 10
- No single role should dominate (currently Full Stack appears 11x in top 3)
- Specialized roles need lower flexibility and more extreme ideal traits
