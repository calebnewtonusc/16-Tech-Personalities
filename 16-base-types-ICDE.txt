16 BASE PERSONALITY TYPES (I-C-D-E Format)
==========================================

Focus (B/A) is the 5th modifier dimension - defaults to 50 (neutral) on static pages
The 4 core dimensions define the base personality:

MODIFIER DIMENSION (not part of base type code):
-------------------------------------------------
Focus: B (Builder) or A (Analyzer)
- Defaults to 50 (neutral) on static personality pages
- Determined by quiz and shown in results
- Adds nuance to how the 4 core dimensions are expressed
