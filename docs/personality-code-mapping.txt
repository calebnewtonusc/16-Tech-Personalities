PERSONALITY CODE FORMAT CONVERSION
From: Focus-Interface-Change-Decision (F-I-C-D)
To: Interface-Change-Decision-Execution-Focus (I-C-D-E-F)

CONVERSION TABLE (with thoughtful Execution assignments):

OLD FORMAT → NEW FORMAT | Name | Execution Rationale
==================================================================================
B-U-E-V → U-E-V-A-B | The Innovator | Adaptive (rapid prototyping needs flexibility)
B-U-E-L → U-E-L-T-B | The Product Engineer | Structured (data-driven needs discipline)
B-U-O-V → U-O-V-A-B | The User Advocate | Adaptive (user-centric needs flexibility)
B-U-O-L → U-O-L-T-B | The Frontend Specialist | Structured (quality focus needs testing discipline)
B-S-E-V → S-E-V-A-B | The Infrastructure Pioneer | Adaptive (infrastructure innovation needs exploration)
B-S-E-L → S-E-L-T-B | The Backend Architect | Structured (systems architecture needs planning)
B-S-O-V → S-O-V-T-B | The Platform Builder | Structured (platform stability needs discipline)
B-S-O-L → S-O-L-T-B | The Site Reliability Engineer | Structured (SRE needs systematic approach)

A-U-E-V → U-E-V-A-A | The Design Technologist | Adaptive (design research needs experimentation)
A-U-E-L → U-E-L-T-A | The UX Researcher | Structured (research methods need rigor)
A-U-O-V → U-O-V-T-A | The Product Designer | Structured (design systems need consistency)
A-U-O-L → U-O-L-T-A | The Quality Engineer | Structured (QA needs systematic testing)
A-S-E-V → S-E-V-A-A | The Research Engineer | Adaptive (research needs flexible exploration)
A-S-E-L → S-E-L-T-A | The ML Engineer | Structured (ML pipelines need discipline)
A-S-O-V → S-O-V-T-A | The Solutions Architect | Structured (architecture needs planning)
A-S-O-L → S-O-L-T-A | The Data Engineer | Structured (data pipelines need reliability)

PATTERN LOGIC:
- Exploratory + Vision (E + V) → Usually Adaptive (need flexibility for innovation)
- Operational + Logic (O + L) → Usually Structured (need discipline for stability)
- Builder types lean slightly more Adaptive (hands-on flexibility)
- Analyzer types lean slightly more Structured (systematic rigor)
