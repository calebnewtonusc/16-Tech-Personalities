## Database Schema

### Tables
1. **personality_profiles**: 16 base personality type descriptions
   - Stores profiles for each I-C-D-E combination (without Focus)
   - Each profile includes name, description, strengths, and challenges
2. **tech_roles**: 42 tech roles with descriptions and learning roadmaps
3. **quiz_questions**: 40 scenario-based questions mapped to dimensions
4. **role_scoring_weights**: Personality-to-role fit mappings (optional)

### Supabase Setup
The app uses Supabase for:
- Fetching personality profiles by type code
- Loading tech role information
- Retrieving quiz questions

All data has fallback to local JSON files in `src/Tech16/data/` when Supabase is unavailable.

## Scoring Algorithm

1. **Question Responses**: Each question maps to one of 5 spectrums
2. **Likert Scale**: 5-point scale (Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree)
3. **Score Calculation**: Average of all questions per spectrum (0-100)
4. **Type Generation** (Format: I-C-D-E-F):
   - **Interface**: U (< 50) or S (≥ 50)
   - **Change**: E (< 50) or O (≥ 50)
   - **Decision**: V (< 50) or L (≥ 50)
   - **Execution**: A (< 50) or T (≥ 50)
   - **Focus**: B (< 50) or A (≥ 50)

### Example
```
Interface: 20 → U (User-Facing)
Change: 35 → E (Exploratory)
Decision: 45 → V (Vision-Led)
Execution: 40 → A (Adaptive)
Focus: 30 → B (Builder)

Result: U-E-V-A-B (The Innovator)
```

### Static Personality Pages
The 16 base personality types use 4-letter codes (I-C-D-E) with Focus defaulted to 50 (neutral). Quiz results use the full 5-letter code (I-C-D-E-F) with the actual Focus score.

## Role Recommendation Algorithm

**Rule-Based Hybrid Approach** (Mega-Algorithm v2.0)

### Top 3 Recommendations
Each of the 16 base personality types has a custom algorithm that returns the top 3 roles based on manual reasoning and strength analysis:

```javascript
// Example: U-E-V-A (User-Exploratory-Vision-Adaptive)
// Returns: ["Frontend Developer", "Mobile Developer", "UX Engineer"]
```

**16 Type-Specific Algorithms** (located in `frontend/src/Tech16/algo_*.js`):
- One algorithm per base personality type (based on Interface-Change-Decision-Execution)
- Each algorithm considers preference strength (not just direction)
- Handles edge cases: weak preferences, mixed strengths, extreme values
- Optimized for algorithmic consistency on comprehensive test suite
- Focus dimension (B/A) does not affect top 3 role recommendations

**Note on File Naming**: The algorithm files use an older naming convention (e.g., `algo_BUEV.js`) from a previous code format. The `megaAlgorithm.js` handles mapping between the current personality code format (U-E-V-A) and the appropriate algorithm file.

### Remaining Roles (4+)
Distance-based scoring for roles beyond top 3:
1. **Direction Matching**: Same side of neutral (50) on each spectrum
2. **Distance Calculation**: Euclidean distance with flexibility weighting
3. **Hybrid Score**: Weighted combination of direction + distance
4. **Final Ranking**: All roles sorted by match percentage

### Algorithm Performance
- **Test Coverage**: 112 test cases (16 types × 7 strength levels)
- **Consistency**: Rule-based matching ensures consistent results for same inputs
- **Note**: Algorithm has not been validated against real-world career outcomes

### Files
- `megaAlgorithm.js` - Main hybrid algorithm
- `algo_BUEV.js` through `algo_ASOL.js` - 16 type-specific algorithms
- `roleMatching.js` - Legacy distance-based algorithm (used for roles 4+)

## Limitations and Disclaimers

**This is a student portfolio project with the following limitations:**

1. **Not Scientifically Validated**: This tool has not undergone peer review or empirical validation studies
2. **Not a Substitute for Professional Assessment**: Should not replace professional career counseling or psychometric testing
3. **No Hiring Use**: This tool should NOT be used for employment screening or hiring decisions
4. **Entertainment/Educational Purpose**: Designed for personal exploration and learning about personality frameworks
5. **Rule-Based Matching**: Career recommendations are based on predefined rules, not machine learning or real-world outcome data
6. **No Longitudinal Data**: We have not tracked whether recommendations lead to actual career satisfaction
7. **Limited Scope**: Focuses only on technical roles and may not capture the full complexity of career fit

**For Professional Career Guidance**: Please consult with licensed career counselors, use validated assessments (e.g., Strong Interest Inventory, Myers-Briggs Type Indicator administered by certified professionals), or work with your university's career services.

## Deployment

### Production
Deployed on **Vercel** at [https://16techpersonalities.com](https://16techpersonalities.com)

### Environment Variables
Required for Supabase integration:
```bash
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

Set in Vercel dashboard or via CLI:
```bash
vercel env add REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL production
vercel env add REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY production
```

### Local Development
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Create a `.env` file with Supabase credentials, or run in client-side only mode (localStorage fallback).
